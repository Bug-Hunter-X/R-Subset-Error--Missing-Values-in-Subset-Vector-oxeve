This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in R when subsetting data frames using character vectors.  The issue arises when the subset vector contains values that are not present in the corresponding column of the data frame. This leads to unexpected behavior, often resulting in silent removal of rows that could be crucial for analysis, instead of an informative error. The provided code examples illustrate the error and a robust solution.
